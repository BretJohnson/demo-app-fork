Building for iOS:

- Download the latest Mobile Center frameworks zip from https://github.com/Microsoft/mobile-center-sdk-ios/releases.
- Unzip it.
- Open up RNMobileCenter/ios/RNMobileCenter.xcodeproj in Xcode
- Drag in MobileCenter.framework; check "Copy items if needed"
- Switch the scheme to "Fat framework"
- Build
- For validation do: file  ./Products/RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter
  And confirm you see output like this:
  RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter: Mach-O universal binary with 4 architectures: [arm_v7: current ar archive random library] [i386: current ar archive random library] [x86_64: current ar archive random library] [arm64: current ar archive random library]
  RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter (for architecture armv7):    current ar archive random library
  RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter (for architecture i386):    current ar archive random library
  RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter (for architecture x86_64):    current ar archive random library
  RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter (for architecture arm64):    current ar archive random library  

- Zip up the framework:
  cd mobile-center-sdk-react-native/RNMobileCenter
  ./zip-framework.sh



- Build Demo app
- cd into MobileCenterDemoApp folder and npm install
- run react-native link to hook up the native sources and specify app secret
- Run Demo app
- cd into MobileCenterDemoApp folder and react-native run-ios


Bumping version numbers, for components that change (or whose static dependencies change):

RNMobileCenter Android
  mobile-center-sdk-react-native/RNMobileCenter/android/build.gradle
    Add 1 to versionCode (it's just a counter that need be unique)
    Bump the version in versionName
    Ensure com.microsoft.azure.mobile:mobile-center (at the bottom) is correct

RNMobileCenter iOS
  mobile-center-sdk-react-native/RNMobileCenter.podspec
    Bump the version num s.version
    Ensure s.dependency 'MobileCenter' dependency (at the bottom) is correct

NPM modules
  mobile-center-crashes/package.json
  mobile-center-crashes/scripts/postlink.js
  mobile-center-crashes/android/build.gradle (dependences at bottom)

  mobile-center-analytics/package.json
  mobile-center-analytics/scripts/postlink.js
  mobile-center-analytics/android/build.gradle (dependences at bottom)

  mobile-center-link-script/package.json

More about the fat framework build process:

Just to be clear: this is what I mean about the "fat framework" only running a script
that script invokes the build on the RNMobileCenter target a few times and builds the different archs and puts it all together
and it looks like the script does build it in release mode
To see the script:  select RNMobileCenter's root elemetn, select Fat Framework, go to the Build Phases tab, and there is a Run Script target
